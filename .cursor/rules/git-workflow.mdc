## Branch Strategy
- Work on main branch for small enhancements
- Create feature branches for major changes
- Test thoroughly before pushing
- Keep commits atomic and focused

## File Organization

- Don't commit temporary or test files
- Maintain clean project structure
- Document changes in commit messages

## Enhancement Tracking
- Commit after each successful enhancement
- Push changes regularly to maintain backup
- Tag major releases if needed
- Keep enhancement plan documents updated

## Code Review
- Test changes locally before committing
- Verify functionality works as expected
- Check for linting errors
- Ensure UI improvements are visible
- Validate AI integration still works

## Documentation
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Keep enhancement plans current
- Document any new dependencies
- Maintain clear project structure
